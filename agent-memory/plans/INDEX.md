## Rejected Ideas (evaluated, decided against — not just deferred)

| Idea | Decision date | Reasoning |
|------|------|-----------|
| `affected --include-contains` (or make `contains` a default relation) | 2026-07-04 | `contains` is universal within a file/doc — every function is `contains`-linked to its file, every automation entry to its YAML file. Including it would return most/all co-located nodes for ANY query, turning `affected` from a precise dependency-impact tool into noise. Confirmed on a real case (`AiOverview.jsx`, a page component with real `imports`/`calls` edges but zero code-level dependents — `affected` correctly reports "No affected nodes found" even though removing the page would drop its route, which is a `contains`-only relation). The tradeoff (precise dependency impact vs. blind to routing/containment impact for entry-point nodes) is intentional; not revisiting without a new real case that needs it. |
| P16 Phase 2 (`file:Label` syntax in `_find_node_core`) | 2026-07-04 | See p16-qualified-node-resolution.md — Phase 1's flags already resolve every real duplicate-name case found; Phase 2 would touch the resolver shared by `path`/`explain`/`save-result` for unproven benefit. |
| Switching `god_nodes()` default ranking from `by="degree"` to `by="pagerank"` or a HITS hub-score (both already/newly measured) | 2026-07-04 | Measured directly on 9 real corpora (75–14,593 nodes), using `cross_cutting_nodes()`'s `communities_bridged` as an independent proxy for "real architectural hub." Undirected PageRank: promotions beat demotions on bridge-score in only 2/8 corpora. Directed PageRank (reconstructed from the committed graph.json's real `source`→`target`, no re-extraction): 0/9 — it systematically *demoted* the actual highest-bridge nodes (`SessionCoordinator` bridge=54, `main()` bridge=57, `BaseEntity` bridge=19) in favor of narrower ones. HITS hub-score: 1/9, same failure. Root cause common to all three: PageRank/HITS are eigenvector-family algorithms that reward membership in a tightly self-reinforcing core clique; an architectural god-node's defining property is the *opposite* — it bridges many otherwise-unrelated communities. Plain (non-recursive) degree has no such bias toward concentration, so it tracks `communities_bridged` better than any recursive centrality tried. Not revisiting this family (PageRank/HITS/eigenvector/Katz) for `god_nodes()` ranking without a fundamentally different validation signal than bridge-score. `god_nodes(by="pagerank")` stays as an existing opt-in escape hatch (`--rank-by pagerank`), not promoted to default. |
